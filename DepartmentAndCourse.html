<p>Within the constraints of prescribed syllabi, LSR attempts to offer an eclectic selection, a range of options for students. The future of the knowledge society of this century depends, among other strengths, upon the rigour of a strong Social Sciences and Humanities orientation. Our Honours programmes in these areas are our assets. LSR also offers Honours programmes in Commerce and B.Sc. Honours programmes in Mathematics and Statistics. In addition, the college offers professional courses in Elementary Education and Journalism and Mass Communication, acknowledging both, the great importance of these fields of knowledge and the special role that women play in these realms. The college also offers a one year post Graduate Diploma Programme in Conflict Transformation and Peace building, a recent and valuable enhancement to the university of Delhi Curriculum.</p>
